# tor-detect-middleware

Tor detect middleware for Express

## Usage

### Install

```bash
npm install tor-detect-middleware
```

### Typical example

```js
const express = require('express');
const torUserHandler = require('tor-detect-middleware')
const app = express();

app.use(torUserHandler())

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const ip = req.headers['x-forwarded-for'] || req.connection.remoteAddress;
  res.send(`Are you (${ip}) a TOR user? ${req.isTorUser}`);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('We are in port 3000!');
});
```

### Redirect Users

In this example we redirect the surface users to `https://www.nytimes.com` and Tor users to `https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/`. You can use both wayt to redirect.

```js
const express = require('express');
const torUserHandler = require('tor-detect-middleware')
const app = express();

app.use(torUserHandler({
    surface: "https://www.nytimes.com",
    tor: "https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/"
}))

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('We are in port 3000!');
});
```

### Ban users from surface or TOR

```js
const express = require('express');
const torUserHandler = require('tor-detect-middleware')
const app = express();

app.use(torUserHandler())

app.get('/surface-only', (req, res) => {
  if(req.isTorUser) return res.status(401).send("You can't access from TOR here")
  res.send('Welcome surface user!');
});

app.get('/tor-only', (req, res) => {
  if(!req.isTorUser) return res.status(401).send("You can't access from the surface here")
  res.send('Welcome to the dark side. We have cookies!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('We are in port 3000!');
});
```


### Custom Cron Jobs

By default we refresh the IP list every hour, but you can modify the ms as you wish. 

```js
const express = require('express');
const torUserHandler = require('tor-detect-middleware')
const app = express();

app.use(torUserHandler({refreshMs: 600000}))

//...
```


### Strict Mode

Special behaviour in Strict mode:
- The server will stop at startup if `https://onionoo.torproject.org/details` url is down
- The server will wait until there is a list ready to dispatch requests. (Few seconds)

_Note: if there is a list stored you wont surfer any problem, as we start the service from the previous list._


```js
const express = require('express');
const torUserHandler = require('tor-detect-middleware')
const app = express();

app.use(torUserHandler({
    strictMode: true
}))

//...
```

### Purge list at start

You can purge the list by default at the startup of the service.

```js
const express = require('express');
const torUserHandler = require('tor-detect-middleware')
const app = express();

app.use(torUserHandler({
    purge: true
}))

//...
```
